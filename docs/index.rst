==========================================



Getting started
--------------------------------------------------------
One key goal of the **MICAPIPE** is
to harmonize analytical methods both *within* and *across* ENIGMA Working Groups, ultimately facilitating
comparisons of imaging and genetic findings across diseases.

Quality Check
------------------------------------
The **MICAPIPE** has a *No data, No problem* policy! To make things easier, we provide from an individual site
that have been processed according to ENIGMA protocols. Using our example data, previously published summary statistics, or any other ENIGMA-derived
datasets, you can easily complete all of the tutorials!
